  goal_text: >
    Evaluate and refine Stephanie’s internal critic by constructing a
    VisiCalc-based cohort analysis across chat turns, identifying stable
    high-signal behavioral features, training a compact critic model, and
    validating its predictive power via HRM/SICQL/EBT agreement. Produce a
    full lifecycle artifact set (raw → metrics → VPM → cohort summaries →
    critic model → improvement deltas) that together form a self-improving
    feedback loop.

  strategy:
    - "cohort_metric_analysis"        # VisiCalc → baseline → targeted
    - "critic_training"               # Train TinyCritic on extracted features
    - "model_evaluation"              # HRM + SICQL + EBT cross-checks
    - "visual_reasoning"              # VPM and color-normalized A/B frames
    - "feedback_integration"          # Update scorer configs & calibration
