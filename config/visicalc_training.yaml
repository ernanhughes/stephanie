    Construct a goal-conditioned Nexus from chat turns, perform blossom search
    (Tree/Graph-of-Thoughts) to propose candidate trajectories, render a
    synchronized A/B filmstrip (baseline | targeted | delta), compute global
    sensemaking metrics (community detection + summaries), and pick the winner
    by SICQL/EBT/HRM signals. Export artifacts + deltas for GAP analysis.
