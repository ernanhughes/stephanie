goal:
  goal_text: Design a system in which an autonomous AI lab can improve its scientific hypotheses over time by analyzing failures, updating symbolic reasoning strategies, and using internal evaluation feedback (e.g., multi-dimensional self-judgment). How should such a lab structure its iterative improvement loop?
