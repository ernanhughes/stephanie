goal:
  goal_text: Develop a reasoning transfer framework where an AI system trained on high-quality reasoning in one scientific domain can apply and adapt those strategies to new, unseen domains using symbolic prompts, scoring dimensions, and MR.Q-guided tuning. How can this transfer loop be optimized for generalization and self-improvement?
