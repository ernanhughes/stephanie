# 🧪 Stephanie: A Self-Evolving AI Research Assistant

> Self-Tuning Epistemic Framework for Autonomous Navigation and Inference Engineering

**Turn research papers into executable reasoning pipelines using local AI.**

Stephanie is a working system inspired by [AI as a Co-Scientist (arXiv:2502.18864)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18864). It combines hypothesis generation, critique, ranking, and evolution — all orchestrated through a modular, local-first multi-agent architecture.

You can think of it as **an autonomous lab partner** — one that reads, thinks, reflects, and iteratively improves its own ideas.

## 🧬 Key Features

✅ Local-first: built for Ollama + pgvector
✅ Full scientific loop: generation → reflection → evolution
✅ Grafting & ranking mechanisms to refine ideas
✅ Signature-based DSPy agents for modular control
✅ PostgreSQL memory for tracking hypothesis evolution
✅ Web search grounding (optional)

## ⚙️ Pipeline Overview

```
Goal
  ↓
Literature Search → Generation → Reflection → Ranking
                                        ↓
                           Grafting & Evolution
                                        ↓
                                Meta-Review
                                        ↓
                                  Output
```

Each stage is powered by a specialized DSPy agent. Agents pass hypotheses, critiques, and scores forward in a zero-shot feedback loop, allowing the system to explore and refine its own scientific thinking.

| Agent        | Role                                                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Literature` | Gathers background from the web or local memory            |
| `Generation` | Produces hypotheses from the research goal                 |
| `Reflection` | Critiques hypotheses for novelty, clarity, and utility     |
| `Ranking`    | Scores and ranks outputs using Elo-style comparisons       |
| `Evolution`  | Improves, mutates, or merges ideas based on top performers |
| `MetaReview` | Synthesizes the highest-quality results into a report      |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set up PostgreSQL + pgvector

```bash
psql -f schema.sql
```

### 3. Start Ollama (required models)

```bash
ollama run llama3
ollama run nomic-embed-text
```

### 4. Run a full reasoning pipeline

```bash
python run_pipeline.py --config pipeline.yaml
```

### 🔧 Example `pipeline.yaml`

```yaml
pipeline:
  goal: "Explore dopamine and learning in RL agents"
  use_grafting: true
  run_id: "dopamine_rl"
```
