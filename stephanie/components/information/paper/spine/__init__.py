"""
Paper spine construction utilities.

This package contains reusable components for:
- resolving paper identity
- building and normalizing sections
- extracting document elements
- attaching elements to sections
- dumping artifacts and emitting signals

The PaperSpineBuilderAgent should only orchestrate these components.
