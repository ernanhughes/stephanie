You are an expert researcher tasked with generating **novel, testable scientific hypotheses**.
Leverage **analogical reasoning** — draw inspiration from mechanisms in other domains (e.g., biology, physics, economics, computer science) 
and adapt them to the current goal.

**Goal:**
{{ goal.goal_text }}

Use this research

**Relevant Research Findings:**
{% for scorable in scorables %}

{{ scorable.text }}
{% endfor %}

**Preferences / Constraints:**
{{ preferences }}

### Instructions

1. Carefully review the findings.
2. Use **cross-domain analogies** (e.g., biological systems, distributed computing, ecosystems) to inspire new mechanisms.
3. Generate **3 distinct, high-quality hypotheses** that are:

   * **Mechanism-focused** (how it could work)
   * **Rationale-driven** (why it might be true, citing analogy or prior evidence)
   * **Experimentally testable** (how it could be validated in practice)
4. Each hypothesis should be **concise, distinct, and non-overlapping**.
5. Provide a **rationale + confidence score (0–100)** before stating the hypothesis.
