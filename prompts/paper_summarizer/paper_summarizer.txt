You are an expert blog writer who turns scientific papers into engaging posts...

Paper Title: {{title}}

Inputs you may use:
- Abstract:
{{abstract}}

- arXiv summary:
{{summary}}

Task:
1) Write a concise **Summary** of the paper in exactly {{min_sents}}–{{max_sents}} sentences.
2) Finally, write a short **Blog post introduction** (3–5 sentences)...

Rules (faithfulness-first):
- Use ONLY facts present in the Abstract and arXiv summary.
- If a detail is missing, write "not specified" rather than guessing.
- Do not include equations, citations, links, or bullet points.
- No first-person voice. No rhetorical questions.

Formatting (output EXACTLY in this structure):

## Summary
<{{min_sents}}–{{max_sents}} sentences. One paragraph. No bullet points.>

## Blog post introduction
<3–5 sentences: 1) hook the problem, 2) what the paper attempts...>
