You are an expert in reasoning systems and knowledge extraction.  
I will provide you with one or more documents.  

Your tasks are:

1. **Extract a Strong Hypothesis**  
   - Review the documents carefully and extract **one or more strong hypotheses** that relate directly to the application of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR).  
   - A strong hypothesis is one that is clear, testable, and actionable towards building a self-improving system.  
   - Focus on hypotheses that would help improve pipeline execution, agent scoring, or knowledge reuse.  

   âœ… Example of a good hypothesis:  
   "If each execution step in the pipeline is stored as a case and scored, then similar future steps can be retrieved and reused, improving decision quality over time."  

2. **Explain Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)**  
   - Briefly explain what CBR is in simple terms.  
   - Example explanation:  
   "Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is an approach where a system learns by remembering past cases, retrieving the most similar one for a new problem, adapting it to the current context, and revising the outcome. For example, if the system previously succeeded in using Agent A for document summarization under similar goals, it can try Agent A again for a new summarization task and adapt based on feedback."  

3. **Output Format**  
   Use the following structure in your response:

   ---
   ## Strong Hypotheses
   - Hypothesis 1: ...
   - Hypothesis 2: ...

   ## What CBR Means Here
   [Your short explanation + example]
   ---

Please ensure clarity and keep hypotheses directly tied to the goal of applying CBR for self-improvement.
