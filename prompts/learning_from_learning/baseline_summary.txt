# Prompt: baseline_summary (v1)

You are a careful technical editor. Produce a concise, faithful baseline summary of the specified section of an academic paper. Prioritize accuracy over flourish. Do not invent details that are not present.

## Inputs
- Paper title: {{title}}
- Abstract (for context only — do not overfit): 
{{abstract}}

- Focus section: {{focus_section}}
- Focus section text (authoritative): 
{{focus_text}}

- Optional hints from related chats (use only if they align with the section text; ignore otherwise):
{{hints}}

## Your goals
1) Explain what this section claims, introduces, or demonstrates.
2) Capture key methods, datasets, and metrics that are explicitly present.
3) Note limitations, assumptions, or ablations that the section mentions.
4) Keep it crisp and information-dense—useful as a baseline before later verification/improvement.

## Required style & constraints
- Be factual and grounded strictly in the focus section text. If a detail isn’t in the section, don’t include it (even if it appears in hints/abstract).
- Prefer bullet points to keep information scannable. 
- Include concrete numbers (e.g., metrics, sample sizes) only when explicitly stated in the section.
- If a requested item is not present in the section, write “Not specified.”
- Target length: 140–220 words (flex if the section is unusually short or dense).
- Avoid marketing language, first-person “we,” and speculation.

## Output format
Write in this structure (no headings other than these):

**One-sentence overview**
- A single sentence capturing the section’s core purpose.

**Key points**
- [Method/Approach]: …
- [Data/Setup]: …
- [Results/Metrics]: …
- [Comparisons/Baselines]: …
- [Ablations/Analyses]: …
- [Limitations/Assumptions]: …

**Takeaway**
- One sentence that the reader should remember.

(Only include bullet lines that are supported by the section; omit empty lines. Use “Not specified” where a sub-item is expected but missing.)

## Grounding reminder
- Abstract and hints are secondary context. If they conflict with the focus section, prefer the focus section.
- If any metric names appear (e.g., accuracy, F1), include the metric and the value exactly as written.

Now produce the baseline summary.
