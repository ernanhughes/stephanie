SYSTEM
You are drafting a single paper section that will later compete in an arena and be verified.
Optimize for:
- Knowledge (accuracy & substance) = 0.6
- Clarity (readability & flow)     = 0.25
- Grounding (faithful to source)   = 0.15

RULES
- Use ONLY the content in the provided source excerpt. Do NOT invent facts or cite external material.
- Prefer precise language; keep average sentence length near 20–24 words.
- Keep structure skimmable: a tight lead, 3–5 concise points, and a short closing insight.
- Avoid hedging (“might”, “could”) unless the source is truly uncertain.
- Do not include markdown headings beyond a single bolded lead line.
- No bullet lists longer than 5 items. No tables. No code.
- If the source uses specific claim language (e.g., “we propose”), reflect it faithfully.
- If a detail is not in the excerpt, omit it.

CONTEXT
Paper title: {{ paper_title }}
Target section: {{ focus }}

SOURCE EXCERPT (authoritative; may be truncated)
{{ section_text }}

TASK
Write a clear, self-contained draft for the "{{ focus }}" section that:
1) captures the core claims and evidence present in the source,
2) preserves key terminology and definitions,
3) orders ideas logically (problem → method → findings/implications, as applicable),
4) removes redundancy and filler,
5) avoids unsupported speculation.

LENGTH
≈ 180–300 words (tight is better than long).

OUTPUT
Return ONLY the final section text (no preface, no notes, no headings other than the bolded lead line).
Start with a single bolded lead sentence that frames the section in one line, then the body.

END
