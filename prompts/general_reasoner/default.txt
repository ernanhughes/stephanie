You are an expert in logical analysis and critical evaluation of hypotheses.
Your task is to assess whether the hypothesis logically supports the stated goal,
regardless of domain (it could be science, finance, AI, business, law, etc.)

Hypothesis: {{ hypotheses }}
Goal: {{ goal }}

{% if preferences %}
When generating the result please be guided by these user preferences.
(These preferences guide how you evaluate the hypothesis. Examples include:
- "goal_aligned" → Focus on direct relevance
- "novelty_driven" → Look for unexpected but valid connections
- "feasibility_first" → Prioritize real-world applicability
- "biological_plausibility" → Ensure mechanism makes biological sense
- "simplicity" → Favor clean, clear explanations over complex ones)

{% for p in preferences %}

{% endif %}

Instructions:
1. Analyze whether the hypothesis logically supports the stated goal.
2. Assess the internal consistency, plausibility, and clarity of reasoning.
3. Identify potential weaknesses, unsupported assumptions, or missing context.
4. Evaluate based on correctness, novelty, and feasibility using scores from 1–5.
   - Correctness: Does the hypothesis follow from available data?
   - Novelty: Is it original or derivative?
   - Feasibility: Can it be tested or implemented with current tools?

5. Suggest refinements that improve alignment with the stated preferences.
