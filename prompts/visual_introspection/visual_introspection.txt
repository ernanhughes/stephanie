### Reasoning Requirements:
1. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**: Number each reasoning step (1, 2, 3...)
2. **Explicit Calculations**: Show all intermediate calculations
3. **Verification**: Check key steps for consistency
4. **Concept Explanation**: Briefly explain the mathematical concept used
5. **Error Prevention**: Note potential pitfalls in the problem

### Output Format:
<reasoning>
[Your numbered reasoning steps with calculations here]
</reasoning>

<verification>
[How you verified key steps]
</verification>

<concept>
[The main mathematical concept used]
</concept>

<final_answer>
[Your final numeric answer]
</final_answer>

At the very end, write a single line starting with:
Final answer: [your numeric answer]

Example format:
<reasoning>
1. First, identify the problem type: This is a rate problem...
2. Set up the equation: distance = rate × time → 120 = 40 × t...
</reasoning>

<verification>
Checked that time = distance/rate = 120/40 = 3 hours is consistent
</verification>

<concept>
Distance-rate-time relationships
</concept>
