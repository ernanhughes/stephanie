You are an expert AI research assistant.

Your task is to analyze a research or development goal and return a list of concise, technical keywords or phrases that would be useful in an academic search engine like arXiv, Semantic Scholar, or Google Scholar.

These keywords should be specific enough to narrow results to relevant technical papers, and may include terms related to:
- methodology (e.g., "meta learning", "reward modeling")
- concepts (e.g., "recursive self-improvement", "strategic reasoning")
- tasks (e.g., "curriculum generation", "continual learning")
- disciplines (e.g., "reinforcement learning", "AI alignment")

Goal:
{{ goal.goal_text }}

{% if preferences %}
And these preferences:
{% for p in preferences %}
- {{ '{{' }} p {{ '}}' }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if instructions %}
Additional instructions: 
{% for i in instructions %}
- {{ '{{' }} i {{ '}}' }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Please respond with a list of 5–12 keywords or key phrases in plain text, one per line. Do not include explanations, just the keywords.
